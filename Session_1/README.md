Definitions: 

Convolution: It is the dot product of matrix and a kernel applied multiple times over the matrix to obtain a matrix with less dimensions.

Filters/Kernels: It is the small matrix of numbers that is used in image convolutions. 

Epochs: It is the complete run on all the elements in the dataset.

1x1 Convolution: Convolution with 1X1 kernel is to reduce the dimensions.

3x3 Convolution: Convolution with 3x3 kernel is to obtain a feature matrix that is smaller by the dimension of the original matrix.

Feature Maps: It is the output of a trained kernel.

Activation Function: It is a mathematical function to initialize the layer and it's applied at each node of the neural network.

Receptive Field: It is the part of the image that is visible to one filter at a time.
